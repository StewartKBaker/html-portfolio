<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Stewart Baker, I started taking this course to dive a little further into web development before taking 
bootcamps. I am really excited to keep pushing through this course and learning everything it has to offer and applying it
to a future job.</p>

<p>I recently just turned 20 and decided its time for me to change some things about my life. I was tired of working an
  ordinary job that doesn't pay very well and I didn't wanna be stuck there my entire life so I decided to start these classes.
  So far its been one of the best decisions I've ever made!
</p>

<p>One of my favorite past times (other than gaming because everyone does that) is building Gundam Figures!, I'm sure you
  could tell due to one of my projects. I just really enjoy putting stuff together and I used to always build Legos until
  I found out what Gundam was. It is a great hobby and can include a lot of Creativity.
